## Test Quality Standards ⭐

### Code Quality
- All tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Mocking strategy: Mock external dependencies (Supabase, APIs)
- Test isolation: Each test is independent

### Best Practices
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear intent and expected behavior
- **Setup/Teardown**: Proper cleanup to prevent test interference
- **Async Handling**: Proper use of `waitFor` and async/await
- **Accessibility**: All E2E tests include keyboard navigation and screen reader checks
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive behavior verified on mobile viewports

### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management validation
- Semantic HTML verification

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements 🔮

### Current Limitations
1. **Visual Regression**: Snapshots need baseline generation
2. **Performance Testing**: Load testing not included
3. **Integration Tests**: Database integration tests require test DB setup
4. **Cross-Browser**: E2E tests default to Chromium for speed

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add load testing with Artillery or k6
2. Implement visual regression baseline
3. Add more component interaction tests
4. Add API contract testing
5. Implement test data seeding automation
6. Add mutation testing for test quality verification

## Test Maintenance Guidelines 📝

### When to Update Tests
- ✅ When adding new features (add corresponding tests)
- ✅ When fixing bugs (add regression tests)
- ✅ When refactoring (update affected tests)
- ✅ When API contracts change (update API tests)

### Test Data Management
- Use `e2e/fixtures/test-users.ts` for consistent test users
- Create reusable mock data generators for complex objects
- Seed test database before running integration tests
- Clean up test data after test runs

### CI/CD Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run E2E tests on pull requests
- Generate coverage reports for code review
- Block merges if coverage drops below thresholds
