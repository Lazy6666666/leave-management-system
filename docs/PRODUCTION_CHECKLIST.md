# Production Readiness Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure all items on this checklist are completed.

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up production database with appropriate sizing
- [ ] Configure database backups and test restoration process
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

- [ ] Configure CDN caching
- [ ] Run performance tests
- [ ] Optimize database queries

## UI/UX
