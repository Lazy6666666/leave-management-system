# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security best practices for the Leave Management System.

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Authentication**
  - Use secure, time-limited JWT tokens for authentication
  - Implement refresh token rotation
  - Enforce strong password policies
  - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users

- [ ] **Authorization**
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Use row-level security (RLS) in Supabase
  - Follow the principle of least privilege

## Data Protection

- [ ] **Database Security**
  - Enable SSL for database connections
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Regular database backups with encryption

- [ ] **Environment Variables**
  - Never commit sensitive data to version control
  - Use `.env.local` for local development (in `.gitignore`)
  - Rotate API keys and secrets regularly

## API Security

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
  - Set appropriate CORS policies

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - Validate all user inputs on both client and server
  - Use Zod for runtime type checking
  - Sanitize all user inputs

## Dependencies

- [ ] **Dependency Management**
  - Regularly update dependencies
  - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
  - Remove unused dependencies

## Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] **Logging**
  - Log security-relevant events
  - Don't log sensitive information
  - Centralized log management

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - Set up monitoring for suspicious activities
  - Implement alerting for security events

## Secure Development

- [ ] **Code Review**
  - Mandatory code reviews for security-sensitive changes
  - Use static code analysis tools

- [ ] **Secrets Management**
  - Use environment variables for configuration
  - Consider using a secrets management service in production

## Compliance

- [ ] **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**
  - Implement data subject access requests
  - Data retention policies
  - Right to be forgotten

## Incident Response

- [ ] **Incident Plan**
  - Document incident response procedures
  - Designate security contacts
  - Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Regular Updates

- [ ] **Stay Updated**
  - Keep up with security advisories
  - Regular security training for developers
  - Security checklist before each release
