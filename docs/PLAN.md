### Updated UI/UX Design Outline with Color Integration
Incorporating the tri-color theme (Blue, Black, and White) as per your overall request, here's an enhanced version of the design outline. I've integrated specific color applications to ensure visibility, professionalism, and alignment with the previous description. Colors are chosen for contrast and accessibility:
- **Primary Blue (#007BFF)**: Used for interactive elements like buttons, links, and accents (e.g., logo highlights, active states).
- **Black (#000000)**: For dark mode backgrounds and primary text in light mode.
- **White (#FFFFFF)**: For light mode backgrounds and text in dark mode.
- **Secondary Gray (#6C757D)**: For borders, subtle backgrounds, and secondary text.
- **Accent Green (#28A745)**: For success indicators (e.g., approved status, progress bars).
- **Red (#DC3545)**: For errors or rejection indicators.

1. **Overall Layout and Structure**:
   - **Header/Navigation Bar**: White background in light mode, Black in dark mode. Logo in Blue. Profile dropdown with Blue hover effects.
   - **Sidebar (Optional)**: Light Gray (#F8F9FA) background in light mode, Dark Gray in dark mode. Text in Black (light) or White (dark).
   - **Main Content Area**: White background in light mode, Black in dark mode. Cards with subtle Gray shadows.
   - **Footer**: Light Gray background in both modes, with Black/White text for readabil

2. **Key Pages/Components**:
   - **Dashboard**: Cards with White/Black backgrounds, Blue buttons for actions, Green for positive metrics.
   - **Leave Request Form**: Input fields with Gray borders, Blue focus rings, Red for validation errors.
   - **Calendar View**: White/Black base, Blue for navigation, Green/Red for status-coded events.
   - **Reports/Analytics**: Charts with Blue accents, White/Black backgrounds for data visibility.
   - **User Profile**: Editable fields with Blue highlights, White/Black profile card.

3. **Design Principles**:
   - **Color Scheme**: Tri-color focus ensures high contrast—e.g., Black text on White in light mode, White text on Black in dark mode. Avoid Gray on dark backgrounds for visibility.
   - **Typography**: Black text in light mode, White in dark mode. Headings in Blue for emphasis.
   - **Spacing and Responsiveness**: Unchanged, with color-adaptive borders (e.g., Gray in light, lighter Gray in dark).
   - **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant contrast; toggle between light/dark modes without losing text legibility.
   - **User Flow**: Color-coded notifications (e.g., Green for approvals) to guide users intuitively.

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Buttons**: Primary in Blue with White text; Secondary in Gray with Black/White text. Hover: Lighter Blue/Gray.
   - **Forms**: White/Black fields with Blue borders on focus; Red for errors.
   - **Data Tables**: White/Black rows, Blue headers, Green/Red for status columns.
   - **Notifications**: Green for success, Red for errors, on semi-transparent backgrounds.

5. **Wireframe Sketch (Updated with Color Descriptions)**:
   - The ASCII art below remains structural but includes color annotations for each section. In code (e.g., via Tailwind in `frontend/pages/index.tsx`), apply these via classes like `bg-white dark:bg-black` for mode switching.

### Explanation and Implementation Notes
- **Color Application**: This ensures the tri-color theme enhances usability—e.g., Blue for actions promotes engagement, while Black/White modes maintain readability. No more Gray-on-Black issues!
- **CSS Integration**: In your `frontend/pages/index.tsx`, use Tailwind utilities like `bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white` for mode switching. Add custom colors via your config (e.g., `colors: { primary: '#007BFF' }`).
- **Testing Tip**: Preview in both modes to confirm visibility; use browser dev tools for contrast checks.
- **Customization**: If you need more granular color tweaks (e.g., specific hex codes or component-level adjustments), provide details or share your current CSS/styling code for targeted edits.
