## 1. Migrations Created & Applied

### Migration: `fix_leave_documents_foreign_keys`

**Purpose**: Create `leave_documents` table with proper foreign key references to `employees` table

**Changes**:
- Created `leave_documents` table with the following columns:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `leave_request_id` (UUID, foreign key to `leaves.id` with CASCADE delete)
  - `file_name` (TEXT, max 255 chars)
  - `file_size` (INTEGER, max 5MB)
  - `file_type` (TEXT)
  - `storage_path` (TEXT)
  - `uploaded_by` (UUID, **foreign key to `employees.id`** - FIXED)
  - `uploaded_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

- Added audit trail columns to `leaves` table:
  - `last_modified_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `last_modified_by` (UUID, foreign key to `employees.id`)

- Created performance indexes:
  - `idx_leave_documents_request` on `leave_request_id`
  - `idx_leave_documents_uploader` on `uploaded_by`
  - `idx_leave_documents_uploaded_at` on `uploaded_at DESC`
  - `idx_leaves_modified` on `last_modified_at DESC`
  - `idx_leaves_modified_by` on `last_modified_by`

**Security**:
- Enabled RLS on `leave_documents` table
- Created 5 RLS policies:
  1. Users can view their own leave documents
  2. Managers can view team leave documents
  3. Users can upload documents for their leave requests
  4. Users can delete their own documents (pending requests only)
  5. Admins have full access to all documents

**Helper Functions** (all with SECURITY INVOKER):
- `get_leave_documents(p_leave_request_id UUID)` - Returns documents with uploader details
- `get_leave_request_total_document_size(p_leave_request_id UUID)` - Calculates total file size
- `can_edit_leave_request(p_leave_id UUID, p_user_id UUID)` - Checks edit permissions

**Trigger**:
- `update_leave_audit_trail_trigger` - Automatically updates audit trail on leave modifications

**Status**: ✅ Successfully applied

  - `manager_id` (UUID, foreign key to `employees.id`)
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default true)
  - `metadata` (JSONB)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

- Created indexes:
  - `idx_departments_name` on `name`
  - `idx_departments_manager` on `manager_id`
  - `idx_departments_active` on `is_active`

**Security**:
- Enabled RLS on `departments` table

  2. HR and Admin can view all departments (including inactive)
  3. HR and Admin can create departments
  4. HR and Admin can update departments
  5. Admin can delete (soft delete) departments

**Sample Data**: Inserted 6 departments:
- Engineering
- Human Resources
- Finance
- Operations
- Marketing
- Sales

**Helper Functions** (all with SECURITY INVOKER):
- `get_department_employee_count(p_department_id UUID)` - Returns active employee count
- `get_all_departments_with_counts()` - Returns all departments with employee counts and manager info

**Trigger**:
- `departments_updated_at_trigger` - Automatically updates `updated_at` on modifications

**Status**: ✅ Successfully applied

2. `get_employee_profile_with_email(p_employee_id UUID)` - Get profile by employee ID
3. `get_current_user_profile_with_email()` - Get current user profile

**Leave Document Functions**:
4. `get_leave_documents(p_leave_request_id UUID)` - Get documents for leave request
5. `get_leave_request_total_document_size(p_leave_request_id UUID)` - Calculate total file size
6. `can_edit_leave_request(p_leave_id UUID, p_user_id UUID)` - Check edit permissions

**Department Functions**:

## 4. Type Safety Improvements

### File: `frontend/pages/api/admin/reports/index.ts`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added import for database types:
```typescript
import type { Database } from '@/lib/database.types';
```

2. Created type-safe role handling (Line 44-46):
```typescript
type UserRole = Database['public']['Enums']['user_role'];
const roleFilter = (role && role !== 'all' ? role : null) as UserRole | null;
```

3. Fixed table references from `profiles` to `employees` (Line 48-50):
```typescript
let employeeQuery = adminClient.from('employees').select('id', { head: true, count: 'exact' });
let managerQuery = adminClient.from('employees').select('id', { head: true, count: 'exact' });
let hrQuery = adminClient.from('employees').select('id', { head: true, count: 'exact' });
```

4. Added proper type casting for role comparisons (Line 59-61):
```typescript
employeeQuery.eq('role', 'employee' as UserRole),
managerQuery.eq('role', 'manager' as UserRole),
hrQuery.eq('role', 'hr' as UserRole),
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminated `any` types
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript enum casting
- ✅ Type-safe role comparisons
- ✅ Compile-time type checking
- ✅ Better IDE autocomplete

**Status**: ✅ Successfully implemented

## 5. Foreign Key Verification

### Leave Documents Foreign Keys:
```sql
leave_documents.leave_request_id → leaves.id (CASCADE delete)
leave_documents.uploaded_by → employees.id (NO ACTION)
```

### All Foreign Keys to Employees Table:
✅ `leaves.requester_id` → `employees.id`
✅ `leaves.approver_id` → `employees.id`
✅ `leaves.last_modified_by` → `employees.id`
✅ `leave_balances.employee_id` → `employees.id`
✅ `company_documents.uploaded_by` → `employees.id`
✅ `document_notifiers.user_id` → `employees.id`
✅ `leave_documents.uploaded_by` → `employees.id`
✅ `departments.manager_id` → `employees.id`

**Result**: ✅ All foreign keys correctly reference `employees` table (not `auth.users`)

---

## 6. Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors (Frontend)
**Status**: ⚠️ NOTED (Not part of backend scope)

The following frontend TypeScript errors were identified:
- Property `full_name` does not exist on type `Employee` (should use `name` instead)
- Type incompatibility in `leave-types/[id].ts` for `accrual_rules`

**Resolution**: These are frontend code issues that need separate fixes. The backend database schema is correct.

### Issue 2: Original Migration File
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

The original `010_leave_documents_and_audit_trail.sql` file had references to `auth.users` instead of `employees`. This was fixed by creating a new migration with corrected foreign keys.

---

## 7. Testing & Validation

### Database Queries Executed:

1. ✅ Verified `leave_documents` table exists
2. ✅ Verified table structure (8 columns)
3. ✅ Verified foreign key constraints
4. ✅ Verified RLS policies (5 policies)
5. ✅ Verified RPC functions (6 functions created)
6. ✅ Verified `departments` table (6 sample departments)
7. ✅ Verified department structure and policies

### Migration Status:
```
✅ fix_leave_documents_foreign_keys - Applied successfully
✅ create_departments_table - Applied successfully
✅ create_get_user_profile_with_email_function - Applied successfully
```

### Table Row Counts:
- `employees`: 7 rows
- `leave_documents`: 0 rows (newly created)
- `departments`: 6 rows (sample data)
- `leave_balances`: 42 rows
- `leave_types`: 6 rows
- `leaves`: 0 rows

---

## 8. Security Best Practices Applied

### RLS Policies:
- ✅ All new tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Proper user isolation (users can only access their own data)
- ✅ Role-based access (managers, HR, admin have extended permissions)
- ✅ Granular permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### RPC Functions:
- ✅ `SECURITY INVOKER` for proper permission inheritance
- ✅ `search_path = ''` to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Fully qualified table names
- ✅ Proper parameter naming conventions

### Data Integrity:
- ✅ Foreign key constraints with proper CASCADE rules
- ✅ CHECK constraints for data validation
- ✅ NOT NULL constraints where appropriate
- ✅ UNIQUE constraints for business logic

---

## 9. Next Steps & Recommendations

### Frontend Type Fixes Needed:
1. Replace `full_name` with `name` in Employee references across:
   - `pages/dashboard/approvals/index.tsx`
   - `pages/dashboard/documents/index.tsx`

2. Fix `accrual_rules` type in `pages/api/leave-types/[id].ts`

### Database Enhancements (Optional):
1. Add department foreign key to `employees.department` (currently TEXT)
2. Create index on `employees.department` for better query performance
3. Add department change audit trail
4. Create view for employee-department relationships

### Documentation Updates:
1. Update API documentation with new RPC functions
2. Document department management endpoints
3. Update schema diagrams to include new tables
