  // TODO: Replace with actual API call
  const response = await fetch('/api/leaves', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  })
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to submit leave request')
  }
  
  // Show success toast
  // Refresh leave requests list
  setIsDialogOpen(false)
}
```

### Data Fetching
Replace mock leave types with actual data from API:

```typescript
const { data: leaveTypes } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['leave-types'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/leave-types')
    return response.json()
  }
})
```
