# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the overall UI/UX of the Leave Management System to create a more professional, consistent, and polished user experience. The enhancement will implement a cohesive design system using shadcn/ui components, establish proportional spacing standards, implement a generalized color palette, and ensure visual consistency across all pages and components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Design System Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and professional visual experience throughout the application, so that the interface feels cohesive and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply a unified design system with consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes across all pages
2. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components for all UI elements where applicable
3. IF a component exists in shadcn/ui library THEN the system SHALL replace custom implementations with shadcn components
4. WHEN the design system is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 2: Spacing and Layout Standards

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper spacing and alignment throughout the interface, so that content is easy to scan and visually organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL apply consistent spacing using a proportional scale (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
2. WHEN elements are grouped THEN the system SHALL use appropriate spacing to indicate relationships (tighter spacing for related items, wider spacing for separate sections)
3. WHEN viewing forms THEN the system SHALL apply consistent padding and margins to form fields, labels, and buttons
4. WHEN viewing cards or containers THEN the system SHALL use standardized padding values
5. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proportional spacing that adapts responsively

### Requirement 3: Color System Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a professional color scheme that works in both light and dark modes, so that the interface is visually appealing and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement a generalized color palette with semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, success, warning, error, neutral)
2. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate color variations that maintain contrast ratios for accessibility
3. WHEN displaying status information THEN the system SHALL use semantic colors consistently (success = green, warning = yellow, error = red, info = blue)
4. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL use CSS variables or Tailwind theme tokens rather than hardcoded color values
5. IF a color needs to be changed THEN the system SHALL allow updates through centralized theme configuration

### Requirement 4: Component Library Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use shadcn/ui components throughout the application, so that we have consistent, accessible, and well-tested UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing UI elements THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components for buttons, inputs, selects, dialogs, cards, tables, and other common elements
2. WHEN a shadcn component is added THEN the system SHALL configure it to match the application's design system
3. WHEN replacing existing components THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality and props
4. WHEN using shadcn components THEN the system SHALL ensure proper TypeScript typing and accessibility attributes

### Requirement 5: Dashboard Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved dashboard layout with better visual hierarchy, so that I can quickly understand my leave status and pending actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics in well-designed card components with consistent styling
2. WHEN viewing leave requests THEN the system SHALL present them in a clean table or card layout with proper spacing
3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL use visual elements (charts, progress bars) that follow the design system
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL organize content with clear visual hierarchy using size, weight, and spacing

### Requirement 6: Form Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved form layouts with better visual feedback, so that submitting leave requests and other forms is intuitive and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a form THEN the system SHALL display form fields with consistent styling, spacing, and alignment
2. WHEN interacting with form fields THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus states and visual feedback
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages with appropriate styling and positioning
4. WHEN a form is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide clear loading states and success/error feedback
5. WHEN viewing form labels THEN the system SHALL ensure proper association with inputs and consistent typography

### Requirement 7: Navigation and Layout Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved navigation and page layouts, so that I can easily move through the application and find what I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the navigation THEN the system SHALL display a consistent header/sidebar with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent page layouts with standardized containers and spacing
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive navigation that adapts appropriately
4. WHEN the current page changes THEN the system SHALL indicate the active navigation item clearly

### Requirement 8: Typography System

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and readable typography throughout the application, so that content is easy to read and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any text THEN the system SHALL apply a consistent type scale for headings (h1-h6) and body text
2. WHEN viewing headings THEN the system SHALL use appropriate font weights and sizes to establish hierarchy
3. WHEN viewing body text THEN the system SHALL ensure readable line heights and letter spacing
4. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the system SHALL apply responsive typography that scales appropriately

### Requirement 9: Interactive Elements Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and consistent interactive elements, so that I know what is clickable and receive appropriate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear hover states with appropriate visual feedback
2. WHEN clicking buttons or links THEN the system SHALL provide active/pressed states
3. WHEN elements are disabled THEN the system SHALL apply consistent disabled styling with reduced opacity
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL display clear focus indicators that meet accessibility standards

### Requirement 10: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the enhanced UI to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast ratios
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML
4. WHEN forms have errors THEN the system SHALL announce errors to assistive technologies
