# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Leave Management System needs to be prepared for production deployment by removing all development artifacts, test files, mock data, and debug code. This cleanup ensures a clean, secure, and professional application ready for real users with proper empty states and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Development and Test Artifacts

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all development and test artifacts removed from the production codebase, so that the application is clean and secure for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any test scripts or debug files
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_GUIDE.md`, or `*_VERIFICATION.md` files
3. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any `__tests__/`, `e2e/`, or `test-results/` directories in the production build
4. WHEN checking build artifacts THEN the system SHALL NOT contain `.next/`, `.ts-out/`, `node_modules/`, or `.temp/` directories in version control
5. WHEN reviewing scripts THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any development-only npm scripts or test configuration files

### Requirement 2: Clean Mock Data and Hardcoded Values

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want all mock data and hardcoded values removed from the application, so that users see proper empty states and real data flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display proper empty states instead of mock data
2. WHEN viewing team pages THEN the system SHALL show actual team data or appropriate empty states
3. WHEN accessing profile pages THEN the system SHALL display real user data from the database
4. WHEN viewing leave requests THEN the system SHALL show actual leave data or empty state messages
5. WHEN examining components THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded mock data variables
6. WHEN reviewing API responses THEN the system SHALL NOT return any placeholder or test data

### Requirement 3: Remove Debug Code and Console Statements

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all debug code and console statements removed, so that sensitive information is not exposed in production logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any `console.log`, `console.warn`, or `console.error` statements except for intentional error logging
2. WHEN examining code THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any TODO or FIXME comments
3. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded test credentials or API keys
4. WHEN reviewing API calls THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any debug endpoints or test data
5. WHEN inspecting environment files THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any development-specific debug flags

### Requirement 4: Implement Proper Empty States

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see helpful empty states when no data is available, so that I understand the current state of the application and know what actions I can take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no leave requests exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with a message and action to create a new request
2. WHEN no team members are found THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message
3. WHEN no documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with upload instructions
4. WHEN dashboard has no data THEN the system SHALL show empty state cards with zero values and helpful text
5. WHEN lists are empty THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about the empty state

### Requirement 5: Secure Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all environment files to be properly configured without hardcoded secrets, so that the application is secure in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing environment files THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded production credentials
2. WHEN examining example files THEN the system SHALL only contain placeholder values
3. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all sensitive data
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL have proper environment variable documentation

### Requirement 6: Graceful Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive helpful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options where appropriate
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with clear messaging
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level error messages
5. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL show a generic error boundary with recovery options

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization for Production

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and perform well, so that I can efficiently manage leave requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL have optimized bundle sizes without development dependencies
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL use code splitting for optimal loading
3. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching strategies with React Query
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination where appropriate
5. WHEN images are used THEN the system SHALL have optimized image loading with Next.js Image component
6. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL have minified CSS and JavaScript bundles

### Requirement 8: Clean Documentation and Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to have clean, production-ready documentation without development notes, so that the code is professional and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code comments THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any development notes or temporary comments
2. WHEN examining README files THEN the system SHALL contain only production-relevant documentation
3. WHEN checking inline comments THEN the system SHALL have only necessary business logic explanations
4. WHEN reviewing API documentation THEN the system SHALL reflect actual production endpoints and schemas
5. WHEN inspecting configuration files THEN the system SHALL have clear, production-appropriate comments
